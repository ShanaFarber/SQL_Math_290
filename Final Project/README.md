# Final Project

We wanted to try and combine the number of ratings per book and the average rating for that book into an accurate weighted rating to see which books are most popular. After trying a few variations that did not seem entirely accurate, we found a link online that included a formula for top rated movies in the IMDb database ([Linked here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/6418/rating-system-taking-account-of-number-of-votes)). Based on this formula, we created a formula for our books rating database, using 100 as the "minimum amount of ratings needed to qualify."

The highest rated books were the first 5 Harry Potter books.
